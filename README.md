# aRpsDCA
### an R package for Arps decline-curve analysis

aRpsDCA provides R implementations of functions for carrying out Arps decline-curve analysis on oil and gas production data.

aRpsDCA currently implements the following decline-curve type:
* Exponential
* Hyperbolic (and harmonic)
* Hyperbolic with terminal exponential (aka "modified hyperbolic", "hyperbolic-to-exponential")

aRpsDCA provides functions to compute rate and cumulative production over time, as well as for decline and time unit conversions.

aRpsDCA is currently released under the LGPL v2.1 pending further review.
